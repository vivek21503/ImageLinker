I know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.

The greatest benefit has been when writing music at the computer and needing to set a guitar down to use the keyboard/mouse - just easier for me than a hanging stand.

We have several and gave one to a friend for Christmas as well. I've used mine on stage, and it folds up small enough to fit right in my gig bag."

The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy."

I figured a lot of time would be during the ""adjustment"" phase of the build. Nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. What a pleasant surprise since in past builds I'd spent an hour or more getting them set. I've used Fender and Warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. The proof had been in the pudding though. This neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. No problems. I use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs. I buy more!"

I was fortunate enough to have a location where a stud was available (and I would highly recommend using a stud for the install), however 2 heavy duty screw-in wall anchors also come with the unit for drywall mounting.

12V and 18V out allows for easy hookup into those oddball pedals (just make sure you don't plug your 9V pedal into one of those slots).

I would recommend this item to anybody compiling their first pedal board. I know you can just pop a 9V battery in most pedals and away you go, but...

It packs a serious punch in terms of output and feels quite sturdy. It has a very thin profile and the housing is a thick rugged plastic. Mounting hardware feels smooth and easy to adjust. The display on the back is larger than other lights of this style which is nice when configuring DMX channels. I control mine via a software DMX system, so I can't speak for the built-in modes. It has worked flawlessly in a DMX environment.

I was curious how this light would perform vs. the more expensive 4-in-1 style, and to my surprise the color-mixing is very smooth and has very litle 'rainbow' effect when used as a wash/uplight. I recently played a gig at a winery and used this light for back-lighting the stage. This light is on the rear-left in the attached pictures, with the GBGS 8Wx9 on the right.

The guitar both looks and feels great. The finish is very well done. It's got a warm and full sound to it that I really enjoyed, that at times I found myself reluctant to stop playing. And I was really pleased with how smooth the fretting was, it felt like it took less effort to move between the frets and press down than on several guitars I've played on previously.

The only gripe I have is that the fret position markers (dots) are really dark and hard to spot (see pictures). But that's not a deal breaker by any means, since when playing you would normally look at the markers on the side of the neck, which were pretty clear. Still, aesthetically the dark markers don't look as nice.

But overall I was quite impressed, especially for such a great price. You know a guitar is good when it encourages you to play more often again, and makes it hard to stop and put it down."

One of the few things that has been made in this century that is decent. I use it in a studio rack that replaced a Mackie 1202VLZ, a Yamaha REV500 DSP and a Behringer 31 band DEQ2496. Was a little reluctant to replace all these devices, but over time I gave in as I learned/experimented more with this mixer. I control it with an IPAD Air 2- prefer it over Android as I can place the RTA, the EQ and the channel strip all on the same screen without having to toggle. My only small gripe is that updates and development of the IOS XAir app have not been much of a priority (2 years between 1.42 and 1.5?) . It can be a little overwhelming- after 6 months, I'm still learning more about it and that's a good thing- they'res stuff I can do with this mixer that I could not do with any analogue mixer I've had/used.

I bought these panels for a home studio, mostly for mixing a tracking as I don't do much live recording there. There is definitely a difference and the early reflections from the monitors are lessened (to my ears anyway). They did the job I needed and they look good too! I opted to pin them to the wall with t-pins instead of using adhesive. For my use it works well and I can remove them with little or no damage to the wall. I ordered a second box to put in a pattern on the one remain wall that could use some treatment.

That guy was 100% correct! I just popped out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade and my V67G slipped right in and could be tighly secured using the black mounting ring supplied with the V67G.

I had read a lot of negative reviews about the MXL shockmount for this microphone so I didn't want that one.  This shockmount bears a striking resemblance to the MXL 890 shockmount that came standard with my 890 vocal mic and with the same quality of construction.  The price is definitely more than fair for what you get here!

So... If you have an MXL V67G order with confidence!  I would say that this would be a much better choice than the MXL alternative.

I have changed this rating from 5 stars to 2. The 90 degree connectors are poorly built. They are pressed together and easily break apart. I believe the connection on the 90 degree end is also the culprit for occasional noise. The straight ends seem to hold up well though."

Even with just a few knobs it's easy to get lost for hours playing this thing.  My favorite match is with my Chapman ML-1 Hotrod...which only has a volume ""tone"" control (EVH fans get this).

I have a similar Epiphone case for my Sheraton and that case closes properly like my shoe box example. So beware production quality may not be consistant and could vary on a case to case basis (I couldn't resist that pun).

Also, I feel my guitar should fit more snugly inside the case similar to how my Gretsch G5120 Electromatic fits inside its Gretsch G6241FT Flat Top case. My Gretsch G5120 has a snug (almost tight) fit inside its G6241FT case which allows absolutely no wiggle room.

In addition to this head I upgraded to the 10"" (ASIN: B0002E1FQW) on my other mounted tom and the 14"" (ASIN: B0002D0DSO) on my floor tom.  The results were so dramatic that I also upgraded the batter side head on my bass drum with the 20"" bass drum head (ASIN: B0002D0E3S).

Tips for wah success:
- rock pedal all of the way forward
- match the volume knob to your Bass
- crank the ""Q""
- love life!

Seriously, the range this pedal hits when the ""Q"" is amazing. I love how expressive the tone is when you get it going! I think it retains the low end and adds a creamy wah in the highs and mids. Don't listen to nay-sayers that claim you lose lows!

To put it bluntly, it's needed on your board!
I've used it with delays, octave up/downs, and overdrives, and just the straight-up clean; never found a sound I didn't like or couldn't use!

And they WILL work on a straight shaped mic with the aid of a hair-tie, rubber band, gaff tape, etc. For size reference, see pic. I have the blue one on an SM-57.

So I got a replacement and this one is almost perfect but for the volume knob on the guitar makes static when you turn it up or down.

Exchanged from Mackies Thumps 12.
Difference is huge. Amazing clarity, even response, smooth high and lot of bass if you need it (via EQ).
Mackies back plate is hot all the time and that worried me, Yamaha cool all the time with active cooling.
Mackies dip around 2.5 K which makes them muddy and (crossover too high 3K), Yamaha no dips in frequency range, super clear and tight bass.
Fantastic for outdoors since they can go loud without losing clarity. For big bass lovers (boomy) get a inexpensive subwoofer.
It is much better solution than getting 15 inch cabinets since the bass will be seperated better from woofer and 12 inch deliver more even and clear mids.
I listen to QSC 10 & 12 in comparison and they sounded not as clear including bass plus they are much heavier."

I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield."

Also the bracket that attaches the clamp to the cup holder uses a single screw, which loosened up while I was trying to attach the clamp to a mic stand. I was able to tighten it up, but I needed to remove the bracket in order to do so. Further, even after tightening this screw, the bracket still had a tendency to swivel."

She was using a $100 Sennheiser E835 Dynamic Cardioid and *hated* it so I decided to fix that situation. With no change other than plugging in the Shure Super 55, adjust input trim on mixer and some minor EQ, the difference in her voice was remarkable. Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon."

I have a TS9DX and TS9 that were made for Ibanez by Maxon in the 90's that were modded to 808 spec, and this pedal sounds dead-on to that sound.

The sound has been kind of a blanket statement of ""transparent light to medium drive"". Like any Tube Screamer, this has a great drive on its own, can push an overdriven amp without adding color, and can stack well with other pedals. It's definitely a smoother overdrive than other Tube Screamers or clones I have.

The pedal I'd compare this to the most would be the Ibanez TS808, obviously. The sounds of the 2 pedals are very similar, but the OD808 is a little smaller, has a normal stompswitch, and costs a little less than the TS808 Reissue. This is definitely the real deal by the company that's been making Tube Screamers longer than anyone else. Definitely one of my favorites along with the Electro-Harmonix East River Drive.

Bottom line; the Maxon OD808 is what a Tube Screamer should sound like."

One thing I should say: it arrived in pretty rough shape.

The sound is similar to pedals costing much more.  Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!"

The result is that the extra fret pushes the pickup down so it no longer lines up. (See picture) The only way to get this thing to fit would be to dremmel it. I don't have a dremmel. I also think it would look horrible to have to saw out that much plastic."

To be fair, this is a softside padded case, so I won't be throwing it around like a stevedore, but the quick-draw action makes it fast and easy to pull the lights for set up. And packing is faster, too.

This is not due to abuse, climate or bad design ... it's junk plastic.  Too bad - the fit and finish of this case is perfect for my Gibson Les Paul R8 VOS. I love the design and light weight, but there's no way I'd risk carrying my guitar in it now.  The handle is going to fail at any moment.

UPDATE 19 Feb 2015: I contacted SKB through their website about the handle issue.  They promptly shipped me a replacement handle, with new mounts and instructions. Hopefully the materials problem has been resolved in this replacement part. I really appreciate the follow-through from SKB and added a star to this review for that."

I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. I bought 7 sets, so I still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly I'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.

There are few common Dunlop guitar picks for you to look at.
The XL size is good for people with larger hands, I personally prefer standard sized one.

I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away. I go back and forth between Kolstein and Pop's.

It would have been nice to have more effects and greater control over their parameters.
It sucks that the tone feature is only usable in 440hz tuning. Also the manual recommends placing it to the front of your effects chain, but If you've got pedals which don't play well with others like my Blackout Effectors Fuzz Bear, you should put it after those, as it tends to overdrive your output signal. With this having the functionality of a stompbox you'd want to mount it within your first line of pedals on your board for ease of switching, but the amount of cables running at the back takes up needed space if your pedal board is small . But for vocal basics it's a good starting point."

It's passive, so it doesn't color the sound, it makes for easy switching between my two sets of monitors, and even has an auxiliary input (RCA connection) with separate volume control (which I use to patch in an xbox.

I chose to mount it under my desk with the included brackets (mounted upside-down so the box is hanging) so that it's right at arm height for extremely quick access. People have said the headphone amp isn't great, but I've never used it as I connect my headphones directly to my interface when needed, so I can't comment on that claim.

Using strap locks, I would prefer if they used a metal part instead of the plastic part. But the separation is a real downer. All they would have to do is sew or use better glue.

The string itself is the time tested DR Sunbeam round core with the custom micro-coating applied.  The same great tone you get from the Sunbeam string with the added benefit of reduced string and fret noise.

Due to the unheard of low price, I half expected to get a ""half fast"" performance from this pedal, but fortunately, this was not the case. Upon plugging in the unit, and testing it with my Les Paul guitar, and my practice amp, I was amazed to hear how well this inexpensive pedal was able to replicate those old-school tones. This included emulation of multiple reverb types, such as  ""spring"", ""plate"", ""hall"", ""gate"", ""room"", and a really cool new one called ""modulate"" that throws a hint of chorus into it.

The mic is very clear when using this recording device.  He uses the Magix Music Maker to record his music.  It is excellent and he has not had any issues with it at all.  I asked him if there was anything negative about it and he said all he can think of is how perfect it is.  You can adjuster mic volume, very clear, he has not heard any cut outs.  The only con is if you leave it plugged in to the USB when you are not using it your voice will sound static, but he said its an easy fix you just unplug the USB and plug it back in.

Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.  It has a lot of character as it's frequency response is far from flat.  Attenuation of the lows and a pretty beefy boost in the presence without going too bright.

Second, when it comes to tone, I am very picky. I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.

It is just a label. I'm on month 5 and it is holding up. Play it everyday. Upgraded the mouthpiece to a Clark Forbes Debut mouthpiece. The reeds that the sax comes with isn't that great. Mine came with Lazarro reeds 2 1/2 strength and now I use D'Addario Select Jazz reeds 3S and it does the trick.  If you know how to take care of the saxophone it'll last. Well worth the investment. This is the perfect saxophone for those looking for a great instrument without paying hundreds to thousands of dollars.

Edit (after five weeks): I just changed the strings and there is good and bad. First, the bad: the holes for the strings in the tuning pegs had to have been drilled by a nearsighted drunkard. They were all way off-center and most likely weaken the pegs.
Now for the good: I replaced the original strings with D'Addario Pro Arte strings and it made a world of difference. It now sounds just as a violin should and is much more enjoyable to play."

Answer is .......... Yes!

This particular stand is very compact, snaps into place and holds my equipment perfectly.  Given that the feet sit flush to the ground, it creates a balance that keeps the instruments from wobbling while on the stand.  I currently use as my pro setup a Yamaha 62-iii tenor, and an allora paris (woodwind and brasswind pro model) soprano.  I am attaching a photo so you can see the setup.

Why the deduction?

- The adhesive back could be stickier.  I used regular scotch tape to strength where it would not adhere.  I think it will stick best to non-textured and gloss surfaces.

you can stick them to any part of your drum head to dampen sound as needed. They even work on cymbals if you're looking for a quicker decay!

The closer to the center (or more pads you use), the more dramatic the effect. You can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed. If you drop them or they end up getting too dirty to stick to anything, you can wash them in the sink with dish soap and air dry them.

They sound awesome with lots of punch and, they stay clean on the low notes. Im impressed with em.
The down side would be:
1. The covers are not connected to the pickups and, the adjustment springs support the covers. So, you need to glue the covers on so the weight of the pickup doesn't pull loose and fall into the cavity over time. I used clear epoxy and, hoping for the best since I sold the bass when it was finished. On a positive note, the screws and springs were included which was very nice.
2. The covers have sharper corners than standard precision bass pickups so, if you use a template to route cavities,  you'll probably have to go back and chisel the corners like I did.
Im not a fan of that since it doesn't look as professional but, I was using a chrome pickup cover so, it worked out.
The owner of the bass can't say enough about their sound and, I would buy them again."

I have not made any adjustments since swapping out the beater, but I am considering putting a little weight on the beater to make it feel a little more significant.  As far as sound, it's the old school thump.  With my 24"", it rings ever so beautifully.  This may not work so well for hard rock or metal.  Too much bong and not enough bop."

It will be tuned fast and stays in tuned for weeks, they only need VERY minor tuning every now and then. Even the wounded G doesn't bother me, it's pretty subtle you almost wouldn't feel it.

One minor complaint I have is that the shoulder strap adjustment buckle prevents you from placing the pad in the middle of the strap if you tighten the strap from just before medium to ""tightened all the way.""  This is not a big deal to me, because I can sew/create a better strap system.

I was even able to top-load the strings through the holes where the intonation screws originally fed through, just to piss off the purists.  It worked so well that I am doing the same modification to another of my import strats, but this time with graph tech saddles.  Those ones will work as well, but I have to sand off some injection mold flaws first (although that will be easy as well).

Update:  this case can hold a variety of guitars, including a jaguar, les Paul, Strat, Tele, and G&L fallout.  As I mentioned previously, you may need to add some padding or a Velcro strap over the next report to stabilize the guitar.

They were very comfortable and stayed on my finger well without being to tight.  For my fingers I cut the extra piece off and just used the smaller part.  It fits snug under my nail and is the perfect length. For my thumb I used the full size of the pick and it worked great.  The material is easy to bend and shape using a file and buffing blocks.  This produces a naturally smooth sound that you can get with your nails.  I got the medium size. They fit great on all my fingers but I might try the larger version for my thumb but the medium works great if you bend the plastic back and it makes it looser around the thumb.

I adjusted them a couple of times (not too high) and may have found the sweet spot. I don't change pickups too often but the fat 50's sounded too farty and muffled to my ears. I also like to play a wide range of styles ranging from Jeff Beck jazz to Yngwie Neoclassical to John Mayer blues. These pickups are able to handle those styles easily. Most importantly they are dead silent and that's important when you're doing a lot of recording."
