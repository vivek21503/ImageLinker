# ImageLinker
Built a Multimodal Retrieval System using Text and Images Data. • Used a pre-trained CNN Architecture VGG16 for feature extraction from images and calculated TF-IDF scores for textual reviews. • Utilized cosine similarity to find the most similar images to input (image, review) pairs based on extracted features and embeddings.
